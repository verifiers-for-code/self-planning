Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The function takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input.\n\n2. **Iterative Process:**\n   - The `while b:` loop continues as long as `b` is not zero.\n   - Inside the loop:\n     - `a, b = b, a % b`: This line performs two operations simultaneously:\n       - It assigns the value of `b` to `a`.\n       - It calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` (`a % b`) and assigns it to `b`.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - When `b` becomes zero, the loop terminates. At this point, the value of `a` holds the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.\n   - The function returns the value of `a`.\n\n**Euclid's Algorithm:**\n\nEuclid's algorithm is based on the observation that the GCD of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by the difference between the two numbers. This process is repeated until one of the numbers becomes zero, at which point the other number is the GCD.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n"

So, the total number of *n*-digit numbers is 9 * 10^(n-1).\n\n2. **Calculate Numbers Starting with 1:**  If the first digit is '1', there are 10 choices for each of the remaining digits (0-9). So, there are 10^(n-1) numbers starting with '1'.\n\n3. **Calculate Numbers Ending with 1:**  Similar to the above, if the last digit is '1', there are 10^(n-1) numbers ending with '1'.\n\n4. **Avoid Double Counting:**  Notice that numbers starting and ending with '1' have been counted twice.  We need to subtract the count of these numbers once. There are 10^(n-2) numbers that both start and end with '1'.\n\n5. **Final Calculation:** The total count of numbers starting or ending with '1' is: 10^(n-1) + 10^(n-1) - 10^(n-2)\n\n\n\n**Python Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (10**(n-1)) + (10**(n-1)) - (10**(n-2)) \n```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n"
